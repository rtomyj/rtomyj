### Yooo My Name Is Javi

This is my personal GitHub and through it I contribute to 2 main orgs ([skc](https://github.com/ygo-skc), [project-next](https://github.com/project-next)) of which I own both.

#### Stats!

#### Languages, Frameworks, etc

Yes I use all these languages, Frameworks, etc in my repos/orgs ðŸ« . I don't like adding what I use in my current professional role because this is my personal GH account where I like to have fun ðŸ˜›. 

##### Languages

> FYI my favorite language is Python but Go is quickly winning me over. Once I started using TypeScript, I started hating JavaScript.

> Python is primarily used to write scripts. Previously, I used Python to analyze genomic data. Now I use it primarily for [web scraping and automation](https://github.com/ygo-skc/skc-scraper).

> I'm phazing out Java in favor of Kotlin in my projects.

> TS is used exclusively for my front end spa(s) ([ex](https://github.com/ygo-skc/skc-site)) and node projects ([ex](https://github.com/project-next/heart-api)).

##### How I Host

> Started using MySQL in my projects then got bored of it and shifted to MongoDB starting with [heart-api](https://github.com/project-next/heart-api)

> Started using Postgres when I migrated a DB to AWS used by [podcast-api](https://github.com/project-next/podcast-api) project. Though I need more experience with tougher queries.
